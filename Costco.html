  <h2>Costco App Redesign</h2>
  <p>This project was a conceptual redesign of the Costco app
    with a team of three designers. The project timeline was two
    weeks and I performed the role of interaction designer.</p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p> We were tasked with creating a Costco app that was designed
    around users. From the get-go it was clear
    that Costco had scaled their website down to fit a mobile screen.
    My first step was to complete a competitive analysis between the
     Costco, Target, Sam’s Club, and Amazon apps.</p>

  <img class ="compA" src="P3/samsclub.jpg"/>
  <p>I listed out UI elements and took a close look at what tasks
    could be completed within each app. </p>
  <p>During this time, my user researcher was completing interviews
      and creating a persona.</p>
  <p>Based on the research, we came to the conclusion that the most
    effective purpose of the Costco app would be strictly for locating
    deals, coupons, and sales in order to draw more customers to the
    brick and mortar locations. </p>

  <p>Feature Prioritization Image</p>
  <p>As a team, we completed a feature prioritization exercise in order
    to determine the features in our MVP. The result that we arrived at
    was that the app needed the ability to search for deals, browse deals
    by category, save deals for later, and locate deals at a specific store.</p>
    <p>Based on the features we selected, I wrote three tasks to
      design the app interactions around.</p>

<p>Keeping the tasks in mind, I hosted a design studio as a team.
  We sketched out the home screen in order to rapidly ideate our UI
  elements and what features to put where. We then discussed our sketches
   and combined them into one master sketch incorporating everything we
    found was effective. </p>
