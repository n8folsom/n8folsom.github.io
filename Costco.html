  <h2>Costco App Redesign</h2>
  <p>This project was a conceptual redesign of the Costco app
    with a team of three designers. The project timeline was two
    weeks and I performed the role of interaction designer.</p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p> We were tasked with creating a Costco app that was designed
    around users. From the get-go it was clear
    that Costco had scaled their website down to fit a mobile screen.
    My first step was to complete a competitive analysis between the
     Costco, Target, Sam’s Club, and Amazon apps.</p>
  <img class ="compA" src="P3/amazon.jpg"/>
  <img class ="compA" src="P3/costco.jpg"/>
  <img class ="compA" src="P3/target.jpg"/>
  <img class ="compA" src="P3/samsclub.jpg"/>
  <p>I listed out UI elements and took a close look at what tasks
    could be completed within each app. </p>
  <p>During this time, my user researcher was completing interviews
      and creating a persona.</p>
  <p>Based on the research, we came to the conclusion that the most
    effective purpose of the Costco app would be strictly for locating
    deals, coupons, and sales in order to draw more customers to the
    brick and mortar locations. </p>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>As a team, we completed a feature prioritization exercise in order
    to determine the features in our MVP. The result that we arrived at
    was that the app needed the ability to search for deals, browse deals
    by category, save deals for later, and locate deals at a specific store.</p>
    <p>Based on the features we selected, I wrote three tasks to
      design the app interactions around.</p>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>Based on the features we selected, I wrote three tasks to
    design the app interactions around.</p>
  <ol class="tasks">
    <li>Find a deal and save it for later use</li>
    <li>Sign up for a new membership</li>
    <li>Find the saved item from earlier and reveal the
      barcode for in-store checkout</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>Keeping the tasks in mind, I hosted a design studio as a team.
  We sketched out the home screen in order to rapidly ideate our UI
  elements and what features to put where. We then discussed our sketches
   and combined them into one master sketch incorporating everything we
    found was effective. </p>

    <img class="dsgnStudio" src="P3/designstudio2.png"/>
    <img class="dsgnStudio" src="P3/designstudio3.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>Using the results of the design studio, I started wireframing
    the screens in Sketch. </p>
    <div class="picBox">
    <img class="dsgnStudioResult" src="P3/dsgnStudioResult.png"/>
    <img class="wireScreen" src="P3/1.0 Feature page.png"/>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>In order to make sure I wireframed every necessary screen,
  I wrote screen flows for each task. Each screen flow is a list of
  the steps that the user would go through to complete each task. By
  listing out these steps, I could see which screens they would be
  visiting and if there were different display states needed for any of
  these screens.</p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>This quick and dirty wireframe served as the basis for the
    digital prototype. </p>
  <img class="p3wf" src="P3/P3 Wireframe.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>The first step in turning the wireframe into a prototype was
    updating any necessary UI elements through the use of symbols. </p>
    <img class="p3wf" src="P3/P3 Prototype.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>Next I wrote task scenarios in collaboration with the user
     researcher, which provided specific details for each task.</p>
     <img class="pTask" src="P3/1.1.1 Deal Page.png"/>
     <img class="pTask" src="P3/1.1.1 Deal Page V2.png"/>
     <p>Finally, I uploaded my screens to InVision and added hotspots
     for usability testing.</p>
     <p>I also shared the prototype with the visual designer so that
       they could create screen mock-ups for our presentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>After the user researcher had completed testing with a
    few people, we met as a team to discuss findings and simple solutions.</p>
