  <h2>Moon Motorcycles Website Redesign</h2>
  <p>This project is a conceptual redesign of a local motorcycle
    dealership’s website using the UCD process. The business, Moon
    Motorcycles, sells used motorcycles and they want to increase their
    online presence in order to bring in more customers. This project
     took place over the course of two weeks, and I was responsible for
     doing Information Architecture, Interaction design, and Usability
     Testing. </p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>My first step in analyzing the website and possible redesigns was to do a comparative analysis between Moon and two other motorcycle dealerships in the are. By comparing to Seattle Used Bikes and Lake City Powersports, I was able to identify UI elements and features that added to or subtracted from the experience of using the website. It also gave me a good idea of the features that are most important for a motorcycle dealership to have on the website. These include motorcycle inventory, sales information, contact information, service, and an about section. This comparison was very helpful in determining what the primary navigation for the website redesign would be. It was also helpful in showing some better thought out page layouts for motorcycle related topics.
</p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgR" src="p2 persona.jpg"/img>
  <p>After completing the comparative analysis, my next step was to look through the lens of a persona. I chose the persona of “John” to design the new website. John is a 38 year old tech savvy father of a 12 year old daughter. He has a few pain points related to online experiences, and I wanted to tailor my design as much as possible towards solving these issues. For each of his pain points, I brainstormed features that would address them in terms of a motorcycle dealership website. While not all of the pain points were applicable to a bike dealer, the important ones that I could address were a lack of sufficient product descriptions, difficult navigation, and lack of trust with unfamiliar retailers. He also had some needs that I could help with such as knowing what’s new on repeat visits, being reassured by familiar brand names, and seeing reviews for different motorcycle models. To sum up all of these needs and pain points, I wrote a detailed context scenario about John using the website. I tried to touch on all of the primary functions of the website, and how the new features would complete a seamless experience for John as he navigates and uses them. </p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>The next step that I went to was creating a rough site map using FlowMapp. This was helpful in giving me a basic visual representation of the ideas I was developing. The basic sitemap I created was very helpful for beginning wireframing as well.</p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="flowmapp.png"/img>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>As I wireframed, I was able to pull from my site map and I knew for the most part which pages I would need to sketch out. As I wireframed pages I was able to iterate on my original site map, adding or moving pages as the structure of the website became more clear. As I was getting comfortable with my wireframe, I started framing some user tasks that would be completed on the prototype.</p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="p2 wireframe.png"/img>
  <p>I ended up with four tasks that would test the primary feature of the website, like viewing the motorcycle inventory and scheduling service. They would also test the general usability of the website by asking the users to navigate and find secondary information and navigation. For each task, I created a screen flow to help myself design the screens to make each task easy to complete. Once I had all of the screens and steps for each task listed out I revisited my wireframe. By going through each step on each task I further refined my wireframe and sitemap to the point where I felt like I had created all of the necessary screens for the tasks to be completed. At this point, I was able to start turning my wireframe into a working prototype.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>In order to create a prototype from my wireframe, I took all of the tasks and user flows and applied them to the wireframe. This mostly included adding in text and other information that was important to completing the tasks. I also took the chance to revisit my UI heuristics. Going through every page, I made button appearances as obvious as possible, added arrows and highlights on the nav bar to make it as intuitive as possible, and did an examination of where the fold line would fall on each page. At this point I put my pages up on InVision and began adding hotspots to make the clickable prototype. By running through each task on my own a few times, I got the prototype as close as possible to a real website and was ready for usability testing.
  </p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>I conducted three usability tests in order to gauge the success of my UI design and find problems that I could solve. The usability tests were very successful and I received a large volume of helpful feedback that would drive my next iteration. While there were no issues that prevented users from completing any of the tasks, there were some problems that all of the users encountered. Luckily, they appear to be simple problems that can be fixed with minimal effort. I also ran into a few issues that were unique to one or two users and will better inform my heuristics evaluation of websites I design in the future. These were issues such as pages that made users uncomfortable because of multiple links that lead to the same place. My father, who has low technological empathy, also lead me to a couple of interesting discoveries that I will keep in mind for future design projects. He mentioned that a search bar is extremely important for locating information on a site for him, and if one is not present he will often resort to returning to Google search even if he is searching for content on a specific website. I also learned that scrolling down is not intuitive for him unless it is extremely obvious that there is content that continues past the fold. The was not a problem at all for my other two test users, who are younger and instinctively try and scroll down on every page that they visit.
   </p>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>Throughout the whole process of researching, designing, and prototyping I had many learning opportunities. While I feel like the techniques I used proved to be effective for the most part, I can’t help but feel like I could have had better designed features. Whether this is a result of my inexperience or I did not perform enough discovery exercises I am still unsure, but in the future I will be better informed in both regards. One thing that was without a doubt successful was usability testing. I am looking forward to applying what I have learned to further build my UX foundation in the next projects.
