<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
<div class="Content">
  <h1>Moon Motorcycles Website Redesign</h1>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
     <p><span class="emph">Goal: </span>This project is a conceptual redesign
       of a local motorcycle dealership’s website using the UCD process. The
       business, Moon Motorcycles, sells used motorcycles and wants to increase
       their online presence in order to bring in more customers.</p>
     <p><span class="emph">Roles: </span>Information Architect,
       Interaction Designer, and Usability Tester.</p>
     <p><span class="emph">Duration: </span>Two weeks.</p>
</div>

<!-- COMPARISONS -->
<div class="Content">
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>My first step was to take a deeper look at the Moon Motorcycles website,
    as well as the websites of two other motorcycle dealerships in the area.
    I took note of UI elements, navigation, and features that were used for
    each dealership site. This comparison gave me a good idea of the
    features that are most important for a motorcycle dealership to have on the
    website. These include motorcycle inventory, sales information, contact
    information, service, and an about section. I also got a good ideas as to
    what the primary navigation for the website redesign would be.
</p>
</div>

<!-- PERSONA -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgL2" src="p2 persona.jpg"/img>
  <h2>Persona</h2>
  <p>A persona for this project had already been constructed and given to me
    to work with. In order to design around John's pain points, I brainstormed
    features that would address them in terms of a motorcycle dealership website.
    I also took note of John's needs and goals to inform my design. To sum it
    all up, I wrote a detailed context scenario about how John would use website. I
    touched on all of the primary functions of the website and how the new
    features would complete a seamless experience for John.</p>
</div>

<!-- SITEMAP -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg" src="flowmapp.png"/img>
  <h2>Sitemap</h2>
  <p>At this point, I had enough information to start planning out the
  different pages that would be in the website. Creating a rough site map with
  FlowMapp gave me a basic visual representation of the site and was helpful
  for wireframing as well.</p>
</div>

<!-- WIREFRAME -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImgL" src="p2wireframe.png"/img>
  <h2>Wireframe</h2>
  <p>As I wireframed, I pulled from my site map in order to know which pages I
    would need to sketch out. As I got further along I
    was able to iterate on my original site map, adding or moving pages as the
    structure of the website became more clear.</p>
</div>

<!-- TASKS -->
<div class="Content">
  <h2>Usability Tasks</h2>
  <p>Before I could turn my wireframe into a prototype for testing, I needed
    tasks and scenarios to go with them. I ended up with four tasks that would
    test the primary features of the website. For each task, I
    created a screen flow and task scenario to help design the screens. The
    screen flow was a list of the steps that a user would go through during each
    task, and the scenario provided specific details for the user to follow.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- PROTOTYPE -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg" src="P2 prototype.png"/img>
  <h2>Prototype</h2>
  <p>In addition to incorporating details from the task scenarios, I also took
    the chance to revisit my UI heuristics. Going through every page, I made
    button appearances as obvious as possible, added arrows
    and highlights on the nav bar to make it more intuitive, and
    examined where the fold line would fall on each page. At this point
    I put my screens up on InVision and added hotspots to make the clickable
    prototype. By running through each task on my own a few times, I got the
    prototype as close as possible to a real website before usability
    testing.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- USABILITY TESTING -->
<div class="Content">
  <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
  <p>I conducted three usability tests in order to gauge the success of my UI
    design and find potential problems. While there were no issues that prevented
    users from completing any of the tasks, there were some common problems between
    all of the tests.<img class="contentImg" src="MMiteration.png"/> Luckily, they appear to be simple problems that can be
    fixed with minimal effort. </p>
    <p>One prevalent issue was that users mistook the navigation button labelled
     "Sales" for motorcycles on sale, when in reality that page contains
    information about motorcycle sales such as financing, test rides, shipping,
    and return policy. This issue could be fixed through renaming the page to
    something more clear, such as "Information" or "Policies".
    <p>I also ran into a few issues that were unique to
    one or two users and will better inform my heuristics evaluation of websites
    I design in the future. These were issues such as pages that made users
    uncomfortable because of multiple links that lead to the same place.</p>
</div>

<!-- NEXT STEPS -->
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg" src="MM_LOGO.png"/img>
  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>Now that the overall layout and interactions of the website have been
  designed and tested, it is time to start with visual design and building
  the site. In order to make sure everything is meeting the client's expectations,
  the design should be verified with them as well. To assure that the site
  meets user expectations, another round of usability testing during the
  visual design phase is necessary.</p>
