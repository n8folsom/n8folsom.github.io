  <h2>NeuFarms App Visual Design</h2>
  <p>The goal of this project was to design a mobile app for a new
    startup, NeuFarms. NeuFarms aims to grow produce in hydroponic
    greenhouses and the mobile app will allow customers to interface
    with the greenhouse and grow exactly what they want. My roles on this
    project were Visual Designer, Project Manager, and Information Architect.
     The team also included an Interaction Designer and a User Researcher.
     The project took place over a three week period.</p>
     <p>During our initial meeting with the client, it became clear
       that I would be developing the branding for NeuFarms in addition
       to my aforementioned roles.</p>

     </div>
<div class="Content">
    <img class="contentImg" src="SoW.jpg"/>
       <p>As the project manager, I started the project off by creating
         a statement of work by meeting with my teammates and discussing
         deliverables and deadlines for the project. I was also responsible
         for giving the client daily project updates and arranging meetings
         with the client.</p>

     </div>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>Fast-forward a bit in the project, as a team we started to narrow down
    our MVP features. In order to do this, we brainstormed all possible
    features, including features that the client mentioned they were
    interested in including. Then, based on research, we sorted the features
    onto a Impact vs. Expectation matrix. </p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="featPrio.jpg"/>
  <p>Through this exercise, we found that the most important features
    would be those centered around monitoring and customizing produce. </p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg" src="CardSort.jpg"/>
  <p>Next, we performed a card sort to come up with the navigation for the
    app. There would be a tab bar with three tabs: My farm, monitor, and
     account. </p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>While this was happening, I was also researching agricultural
    visual design and branding. Imagery of produce and warm colors
    were prevalent and it was clear that the NeuFarms branding should
    incorporate some of the same.</p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="visR.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>During the first week I also started working on a logo. The client
    provided some logo concept sketches. I started off by hand sketching
     and exploring new concepts. Next I went into Adobe Illustrator and
      further iterated on my designs. While designing logos I had a
      correspondence with the client to discuss logo designs and inform my
      design direction. </p>

  <img class="logoImg" src="logo3.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>In order to solidify the brand identity, I sat down with the
    client and facilitated a branding card activity. </p>
    <p>After some further refining via email, we settled on the
      words Sustainable, Custom, and Empowering.</p>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>To further create the brand identity, I put together a moodboard
    using images that the client provided. In order to get the images,
    I asked the client to send me images that they felt represented the
    brand identity. </p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="MoodboardIteration.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>After the images were condensed down to a place I was happy with,
     I pulled colors from the moodboard for a color palette. </p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="Color Selection.png"/>
  <p>Based on my research, I chose colors that would represent
    a sunny day on a farm. </p>

</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p> Next I created four extra shades of each color that could be used in
    illustrations or as highlights/lowlights.</p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="Color Palette Final.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p>For the type in the NeuFarms app I decided to use the system font,
    San Francisco, because we are designing for an iPhone app. SF has good
    legibility and a it has been carefully designed for legibility on phone
    displays. It also has the sleek Apple feel to it, which fits in nicely
     to the NeuFarms brand. </p>
  <img class="contentImgC" src="Typography.png"/>
</div>
<div class="Content">
  <img class="contentImg" src="Elements.png"/>
  <p>Using the colors and an initial wireframe I started experimenting
    with colors for the background, header bar, and tab bar. A blue sky
    gradient header bar, off-white background with sprout rows, and a light
    green tab bar.</p>
    <p>In order to create a more polished appearance and game-ified/fun
      atmosphere within the app, I created a set of icons that would
      represent produce. There is a small version of each icon which can
       be used as a visual representation of farm blocks allotted to each
       crop. The larger icons are used for representing crops during the
       selection and management process.</p>
    <p> The UI elements include a variety of boxes, cards and buttons.
      The UI elements all use a 10px corner radius in order to make them
      more visually appealing. For the action buttons, I used a slight
      gradient in order to give additional depth and make them more appealing
      to tap on. </p>

      <img class="screenNF" src="5.0.png"/>
      <img class="screenNF" src="13.0.png"/>


</div>
<div class="Content">
  <p> I compiled all of my design elements and choices into a style
    guide for the client. This can be used to inform future work on
    the app and make sure that any new branding content is consistent w
    ith the material that I produced. </p>
